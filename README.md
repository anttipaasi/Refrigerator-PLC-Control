# Refrigerator-Temperature-PLC-Control
TwinCAT 3 solution for refrigerator control. The system drives the temperature to the set point, lights up a lamp when the door is open, sounds an alarm if the door is open for too long and sounds an alarm if the set temperature is not reached in an extended period of time. A simulation program for temperature control is also included. No real hardware needed.
